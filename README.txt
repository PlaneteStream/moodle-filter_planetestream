Planet eStream iFrame Filter 

The Planet eStream iFrame Filter converts Planet eStream content added with the Planet eStream 
Moodle Repository Plugin from a flash player format to an iFrame format.  

The conversion takes place for any new Planet eStream items added using the Repository Plugin and 
also for all the existing Planet eStream items already added to your Moodle system using the Repository Plugin.

Using iFrames, Planet eStream system can detect the best video delivery method and use either a 
flash player or a HTML5 player, as appropriate.  This enables the content to be viewed on a wider 
range of platforms including Android and IOS devices.

The iFrame filter is compatible with Moodle v2.3 and later and requires Planet eStream v5.61 or later.
